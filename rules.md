# Rule #1

If you don't self police your kingdom well, everyone in the kingdom will be banned.

# Rule #2

If you make me ban any singular person myself, I will demand you explain to me why you didn't banish him first.

# Rule #3

Do not make me build a vast array of tools to monitor my own product. I will use the platform myself, find out who is responsible, and

then

they will be banned so permanently, god himeslf will be impressed at the duration of the ban.

# Rule #4

The entire site is closed on Saturdays between 8 pm and 3 am the following morning. It's not for maintenance, it's because I want you to find better uses for your time for at least a few hours a week. Behave responsibly.

# Rule #5

There is a list and there will always be a list.

# Rule #6

There is a queue to get in, and there will always be a queue.

# Rule #7

If you close your own account, you can't reopen it for a really long and somewhat undetermined amount of time.

# Rule #8

If you have to block somebody, do it, but don't say I didn't warn you about the consequences.

# Rule #9000

The cybersecurity budget for this project is $0 as of Apr 29 2023. If you reuse an old password for your account, and the site gets hacked, your security compromise is your own fault.

I say again: $0 for cybersecurity. The site's owner, to be blunt, cannot afford a cybersecurity budget so long as rule 9 still exists in the TOS.

# Rule 9001

Don't be stupid: Avoid sharing your personal information on PostMassive. It isn't strictly speaking against the rules, but, keep in mind, I'm too lazy to encrypt your DMs end to end. And as a policy, if & when the CIA asks to see the database, they are welcome to read the whole thing. You've been warned. (N.B. Notice how this isn't in the TOS as its own rule. I reserve the right to tell the CIA, FBI etc. "no" at any time if they have no warrant.)

# Rule 9002

As a law abiding entity, PostMassive can and will show your entire account, all its history, etc. to any law enforcement agency that ever shows up with a warrant to look. You've been warned: It's in the TOS.

### Footnotes

Roly Poly wrote the rules for the site in less than an hour. This is a draft. You are seeing a draft. If & when the site gains a legal team, or a volunteer lawyer to aid in writing the TOS, the TOS will suddenly look like a real TOS. Don't say I didn't warn you.
