# For lurkers

Hi. I have no idea how you found this readme file. I don't share my github with people on purpose unless I really intend to.

If you're reading this, it means you managed to find the PostMassive Github Repo.

Kindly avoid griefing the owner of the repo.

You can clone it if you want to.

You can issue a pull request.

You can make a funny pull request.

You can open an issue.

Just please don't grief the owner. Or he will find you. And then you will be banned from the site for life.
