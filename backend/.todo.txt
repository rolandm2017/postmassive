### 1.

Make it so I can list a bunch of posts. I guess I can already do that.

### 2.

Make user able to post into the DB.

### 3. user CRUD for posts.

### 4. Link Posts to actual Posts DB

- make a dev only Posts db full of 100-200 generic posts.

- posts should not be Twitter, or Instagram ish. Rather something in between.

### 5. Implement payment system. People PAY to be in here.

### 6. Implement blockchain db showing anonymous proof that the db really does only have N people posting at once.

* this is a maybe.
