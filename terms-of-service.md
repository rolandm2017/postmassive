# Rule #2

If you make me ban any singular person myself, I will demand you explain to me why you didn't banish him first.

# Rule #4

The entire site is closed on Saturdays between 8 pm and 3 am the following morning. It's not for maintenance, it's because I want you to find better uses for your time for at least a few hours a week. Behave responsibly.
